* Note on organization. 
  - Keep universal js classes in imports folder
  - Link to universal js files in import.html
  - If a page has an associated css, php, or javascript file, it's best to include all of those pages in 1 foler. See class_builder folder as an example. 


* Note on Using Navbar
  - Include a div with id "navbar:" + relative path to html root. 
  - For example <div id="navbar:../" if you are one folder down from html. 
  - See login.html as an example.
