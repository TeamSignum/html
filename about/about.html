  <h4> About Learning Universe </h4>
  <p>
    Learning Universe changes the structure of learning management sites. We use a "learning map" to show information
    in a connected and meaningful way. Topics are advantageously broken down into small chunks that can be completed and 
    checked-off. We also help students visualize where their fellow classmates are in the course using participants nodes.
    We provide professors with tools to visualize the progress of students and tools to easily build a learning map.
    Of course, both professors and students can view grades, construct and takes quizzes, and discuss topics with each other in discussion forums. Thank you for your interest in Learning Universe.

  <h4> Tutorial </h4>
  Look for tooltips on the class builder and help messages using the help icon on the navbar. This is a brief walkthrough of Learning Universe. 

  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Professor</b>
  <br>
  Register an account as a professor and navigate to the account home page. From here you can click the add class node to create a class. Once  you have created your class you can click on the node from the account homepage to navigate to that class. From here use the toolbar and help messages to construct a high level overview of the class. Once done, open a pop up for a particular node and click on the "Conept Page" link. This will take you to the low level detail view for a particular node. Repeate the previous steps to flesh out the detail view.

  <br>
  <b> Student </b>
  <br>
  Regster an account as a student and navigate to the account home page. Customize your profile by clicking the default
  image node. Add a class by clicking the add class node. Once a class has been added it will appear on your account
  homepage. Click on it to navigate to the high level overview of the course. Each concept node has an associated pop up. 
  Click on the page icon to open the pop up and see node details. Click on a node itself to navigate to the low level
  details view of a topic. Repeat the previous steps to see information on each low level node. You'll notice some nodes
  might be different colors. We have different nodes for assignments, quizzes, and concepts.
